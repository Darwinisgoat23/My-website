    <h1>Hello daddy mumma dude or dadi, welcome to this beautiful website</h1>
    <h2>Please find below some text, and a button. When you are finished reading the text, click the button to continue reading.</h2>

    <div id="a" class="hidden">
        Right, so I is very fortunate and very happy with all his gadgets and loves his headphones but......
    </div>
    <div id="b" class="hidden">
        It would be great if I could get some Nothing ear 2's, and here are my reasons why I need Nothing ear 2's from the best dude in the world!!! Who didn't take me to Scotland, but whatever, it doesn't matter. Daddy is taking me anyway......  
    </div>
    <div id="c" class="hidden">
        Anyway, here are the reasons why I need Nothing ear 2's:
        <ol>
            <li>My old Philips headphones are old now and don't work nicely.</li>
            <li>The Nothings will help me study because I am focused when I hear music.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="d" class="hidden">
        <ol start="3">
            <li>I want to get into mixing sound, and for that, Philips headphones don't support the codecs needed. I have downloaded a free version of Logic Pro on Mac and will use that for editing sound and frequencies.</li>
            <li>I want to enjoy high-quality lossless music, which my Philips headphones don't support.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="e" class="hidden">
        <p>5. With good headphones, I will exercise more and hang from the railing on our roof to increase my height.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="f" class="hidden">
        <p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it Mr. Jain, is to buy me Nothing ear 2's.</p>
        <p>This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds. Ciao!</p>
